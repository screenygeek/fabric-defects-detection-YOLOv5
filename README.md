### Problem Statement
Developing a robust deep learning based fabric defect detection model which can potentially detect and localize simple defects that occur during the production of fabric

### Dependencies
1. Language: Python
2. Architecture/Model: YOLOv5 | (`https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5`)
3. Framework: DarkNet | (`https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet`)

### Dataset Used
Custom dataset built upon ZJU-Leaper Dataset (`https://github.com/nico-zck/zju-leaper-dataset`)

## Credits
This dataset exists thanks to the creators of ZJU-Leaper Dataset
